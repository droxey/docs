- [ ] **Nested Express Routes + Complex MongoDB Associations**:
  Create a RESTful API with nested routes but no endpoint definition or persistence. Students should:
  1. Draw the architecture on a whiteboard or in your notes before starting.
  1. Initialize the database and connect Node via Mongoose.
  1. Create the Mongoose model(s) required in order to query MongoDB.
  1. Implement the resource stubs using Mongoose methods to persist data.
  1. Test persistance and validate that data is properly retreived, created, updated, or deleted for each endpoint.
