# BEW @ Make School: Ideas

_**Fleshed out ideas in bold. Once written and formalized, add a checkmark next to the idea, and add a link to the final content.**_

## Class Topics

### RESTful Routes and Resources

- [ ] History of the Web

---

### Authentication, Assocaitions, and Advanced Queries

- [ ] Benchmarking Backend Performance
- [ ] Design Patterns in Node.js
- [ ] Docsify - Generating Custom API Documentation
- [ ] MongoDB Patterns and Practices
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas - Database as a Service
- [ ] **Nested Express Routes + Complex MongoDB Associations**:
  Create a RESTful API with nested routes but no endpoint definition or persistence. Students should:
  1. Draw the architecture on a whiteboard or in your notes before starting.
  2. Initialize the database and connect Node via Mongoose.
  3. Create the Mongoose model(s) required in order to query MongoDB.
  4. Implement the resource stubs using Mongoose methods to persist data.
  5. Test persistance and validate that data is properly retreived, created, updated, or deleted for each endpoint.

### Advanced Web Security

- [ ] **Keeping Secrets Safe: `dotenv` in Action**:
  Integrate `dotenv` into a RESTful API implementation. Show `dotenv` integrated in a myriad of platforms: Django, Node, Rails, etc. Finally, deploy to Heroku without exposing secrets in a public GitHub repository.
